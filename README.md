# Social-Me

## Purpose
For this challenge, I wanted to create a back-end routes for a social media platform using MongoDb and Mongoose. A user can create a profile and then post thoughts. Other users are then able to add a reaction to a thought. User information can be updated and deleted, as can a thought. Reactions can be created and deleted from a thought. Users are also able to add and delete friends. 

## Built With:
*JavaScript
*Node.js
*Express.js
*MongoDB
*Mongoose
